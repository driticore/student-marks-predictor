# Student Marks Predictor
This is a student marks predictor that predicts a students future marks based on the amount of hours the studied using linear regression

## What I was able to learn from this project
- That linear regression is used when:
--  We use small datasets
--  We have one feature - input we are using
-- There is a linear relationship ( Represented as a 2D array )

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Data Source
[Student Study Hours](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/student-study-hours)

## Algorithm
Linear Regression

## Result
The model successfully predicts student marks with a clear linear trend.

# Note 
- ChatGPT was used to help me understand this project (Which is a Supervised Regression Problem)
